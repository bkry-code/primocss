// Tools - Breakpoints

/*
 * Breakpoint mixins and functions to create powerful responsive sites and apps.
 *
 * 1. Min / max breakpoint mixin, can be used to loop through all
 *    $grid-breakpoints or set individually. Use breakpoint names; xs, sm, md,
 *    lg and xl to set the breakpoint value e.g @include set-breakpoint-min(sm).
 *
 * 2. Returns a blank string if its the smallest of breakpoints, used to create
 *    breakpoint related ultility classes.
